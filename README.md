# Regression-Analysis-Project-2-STA108


The report should begin with a brief introduction (about one page), followed by the parts listed below. The introduction may include the half-page introduction of your previous project, plus something about the current project.

### Part I: Multiple linear regression I. 
Refer to the CDI data set in Appendix C.2. You have been asked to evaluate two alternative models for predicting the number of active physicians (Y) in a CDI. Proposed model I includes
as predictor variables total population (X1), land area (X2), and total personal income (X3). Proposed model II includes as predictor variables population density (X1, total population
divided by land area), percent of population greater than 64 years old (X2), and total personal income (X3).
a. Prepare a stem-and-Ieaf plot for each of the predictor variables. What noteworthy information is provided by your plots?
b. Obtain the scatter plot matrix and the correlation matrix for each proposed model. Summarize the information provided.
c. For each proposed model, fit the first-order regression model (6.5) with three predictor variables.
d. Calculate R2 for each model. Is one model clearly preferable in terms of this measure?
e. For each model, obtain the residuals and plot them against Y, each of the three predictor variables, and each of the two-factor interaction terms. Also prepare a normal probability
plot for each of the two fitted models. Interpret your plots and state your findings. Is one model clearly preferable in terms of appropriateness? 
f. Now expand both models proposed above by adding all possible two-factor interactions. Note that, for a model with X1, X2, X3 as the predictors, the two-factor interactions are X1X2, X1X3, X2X3. Repeat part d for the two expanded models.

### Part II: Mutiple linear regression II. 
Refer to the CDI data set in Appendix C.2. For predicting the number of active physicians (Y) in a county, it has been decided to include total population (X1) and total personal income (X2) as predictor variables. The question now is whether an additional predictor variable would be helpful in the model and, if so, which variable would be most helpful. Assume that a first-order multiple regression model is appropriate.

a. For each of the following variables, calculate the coefficient of partial determination given that X1 and X2 are included in the model: land area (X3), percent of population 65 or older(X4), and number of hospital beds (Xs)
b. On the basis of the results in part (a), which of the three additional predictor variables is best? Is the extra sum of squares associated with this variable larger than those for the other two variables?
c. Using the F* test statistic, test whether or not the variable determined to be best in part (b) is helpful in the regression model when X1 and X2 are included in the model; use alpha = .Ol. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion. Would the F* test statistics for the other two potential predictor variables be as large as the one here? Discuss
d. Compute three additional coefficients of partial determination: R^2_(Y,X3,X4|X1,X2) , R^2_(Y,X3,X5|X1,X2) , and R^2_(Y,X4,X5|X1,X2). Which pair of predictors is relatively more important than other pairs? Use the F test to find out whether adding the best pair to the model is helpful given that X1, X2 are already included.

### Part III: Discussion. 
Discuss about your results from a practical standpoint. What particular parts of the course material do you find most relevant to your analysis in this project (try to be as specific as possible)? Any suggestions on how to improve the linear regression models?
